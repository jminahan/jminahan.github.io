    <h1>Hello!  Welcome to my site!</h1>
    <p>I'm a student with an anticipated graduation date of May 19, 2018 from Lafayette College 
      with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.  If you are interested in learning about me, feel
      to browse through the discussion posts or resume.</p>

    <h2>Resume</h2>

    <p>
      My Resume is available in both an HTML and a PDF version.  I usually distribute the PDF version
      to employers, but both should always be up-to-date and have the same information.

    <h2>Github</h2>
    <p>
      My personal Github account.  You'll be able to see the code for my personal projects here.  I usually
      don't post class projects here or host them anywhere online in the interest of academic integrity moving
      forward.  If you are interested in any of my projects (or just want to learn a little about my thought
      process while coding you can view my...)

    <h2>Discussion Posts</h2>

    <p>
      This section is kind of a catch-all for whatever amounts to a blog for me.  I will usually only post
      "walkthroughs" of projects as kind of status updates (both for my own personal organization needs and 
      or you to get a little closer look into my thought process as I'm working).  Occasionally, I may pretend
      I'm in the early 2000's and blog about my personal experience in the realm outside of coding/computer science,
      but those will probably be few and far between.

    <h2>LinkedIn</h2>
    <p>
      Honestly I rarely use LinkedIn but it has a picture of my so maybe go check it out and connect if you want.
