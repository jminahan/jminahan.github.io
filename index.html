    <h2>Resume</h2>

    <p>
      My Resume is available in both an HTML and a PDF version.  I usually distribute the PDF version
      to employers, but both should always be up-to-date and have the same information.

    <p>
      My personal Github account.  You'll be able to see the code for my personal projects here.  I usually
      don't post class projects here or host them anywhere online in the interest of academic integrity moving
      forward.
